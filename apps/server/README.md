# Bt Lee — Server (Backend API)

Express.js + MongoDB + TypeScript backend for the Bt Lee real estate platform.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in .env with real values
npm run dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start in development with hot reload (tsx watch)
- `npm run build` — compile TypeScript to `dist/`
- `npm start` — run compiled production build
- `npm run type-check` — type-check without emitting
- `npm run seed` — seed database with sample data

## Architecture

Feature-based modular structure. Each feature owns its model, routes, controller, service, and validators.

```
src/
├── config/        — env validation, DB connection, cloudinary
├── shared/        — errors, middlewares, utils, types
├── modules/       — feature modules (auth, properties, wishlist, ...)
├── routes/        — central route aggregator
├── jobs/          — scheduled tasks (e.g. expiring listings)
├── seeds/         — seed scripts
├── app.ts         — express app factory
└── server.ts      — entry point
```

## API Endpoints

All routes are prefixed with `/api`. Example base URL in production:
`https://btlee-api.up.railway.app/api`.

**Authentication** — access + refresh JWTs are stored in `httpOnly` cookies that the
server sets on login/register, so the browser sends them automatically. Send requests
with credentials included. When an access token expires, call `POST /auth/refresh` to
renew it (the client does this automatically on a `401`).

**Response shape**

```jsonc
// success
{ "status": "success", "data": { /* ... */ } }
// error
{ "status": "error", "message": "Human-readable reason" }
```

**Access legend** — 🔓 public · 🔒 logged-in user · 👑 admin

**Rate limits** — 300 requests / 15 min per IP globally; 20 / 15 min on `/auth/*`;
10 / 15 min on `/admin/auth/login`.
